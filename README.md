# TP's list
> List of practical work(travaux pratiques in french) I did during my web training at LePoleS, 
> it was my first experience as a developer, be indulgent
> the objective is to redo a model as best as possible in a limited time (and sometimes without the same tools)
> so sometimes my work will be different and/or less good than the original

# TP's rules
##### set up a correct file hierarchy. The list is exhaustive, use only what is necessary for you.

│   │   ├── **/*img
│   ├── js
│   │   ├── **/*jquery and other
│   ├── index.html
```
## Installation
```sh
Click on index.html(or put it in your browser)
Click on correction.html(when there is one) for the original
```
