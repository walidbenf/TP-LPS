# TP's list
> List of practical work(travaux pratiques in french) I did during my web training at LePoleS, it was my first experience as a developer, be indulgent

## TP02
Integration of the model of the restaurant "Ce soir" set up a correct file hierarchy. The list is exhaustive, use only what is necessary for you.

project > [img] > [css] > style.css [elements] > jQuery other [js] index

You will find textures for the background of the header here: [cg_texture](http://www.textures.com/browse/bare/45356)

The images are in the img folder. To be rearranged in the hierarchy.
For the log you will use the file cerf.svg
Well done !
Bon travail !
