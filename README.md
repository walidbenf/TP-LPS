# TP's rules
##### set up a correct file hierarchy. The list is exhaustive, use only what is necessary for you.
```sh
├── project
│   ├── css
│   │   ├── **/*.css
│   ├── images
│   │   ├── **/*img
│   ├── js
│   │   ├── **/*jquery and other
│   ├── index.html
```

### TP02
Integration of the model of the restaurant "Ce soir" 
You will find textures for the background of the header here: [cg_texture](http://www.textures.com/browse/bare/45356)

The images are in the img folder. To be rearranged in the hierarchy.
For the log you will use the file cerf.svg
